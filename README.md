# Internship Project at Basarsoft
This project was developed during my internship at Basarsoft. The main goal was to build a web-based mapping application with both backend and frontend components. The backend was built using C# and integrated with PostgreSQL for data storage, while the frontend utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Key Features:
- Displaying and interacting with maps using OpenLayers.
- The backend API, built with ASP.NET Core, handles CRUD operations on geometric data stored in Well-Known Text (WKT) format.
